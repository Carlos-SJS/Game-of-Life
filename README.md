# Game-of-Life
Quick implementation of John Conway's game of life.

Includes a version written in Python using pygame as the 2D rendering library.

Also includes a C++ versione, more optimized compared to the python version. Uses SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) library to render 2D Graphics and handle imputs.

In both versions:
 - Left click: Turn Cell on/alive
 - Right click: Errase/kill cell
 - Middle mouse button: drag mouse while clicking to move the viewport in the game world


Based on (John Conway's Game of Life)
